the bash script provided creates the synthetic dataset then runs tests for k=5 
on all three datasets.  to run bash script:

bash run_outlier


to run synthetic dataset program:

python synthetic.py -n 5 -f 10 -min 50 -max 100 -o .02 synthetic.arff

-n is the number of clusters
-f is the number of features
-min is the minimum cluster size
-max is maximum cluster size
-o is percentage of outliers



to run outlier detection:

python outlier.py -k 5 -p .02 dataset1.arff k5_dataset1

-k is number of nearest neighbors to consider
-p is expected percentage of outliers
